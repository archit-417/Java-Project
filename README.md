In this Number Game, the system generates a random secret number, between 1 to 100. The player is then required to guess that number under the following rules:
1. If the player guesses a number greater than the secret number, system replies "Too High! Try Again".
2. If the player guesses a number less than the secret number, system replies "Too Low! Try Again".
3. The user gets at most 10 attempts to guess the secret number.
If the player guesses the number before exceeding his number of attempts, he wins the game.
